* Thanks to http://github.com/amenonsen/gmail-mirror for providing a convenient way to mirror my gmail account into Maildir.  If you have two-factor authentication implemented, and maybe otherwise, you will need to setup an application specific password in google for gmail.  https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords will let you add or manage your app-specific passwords.

* I ran across http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/google-has-most-of-my-email-because-it-has-all-of-yours in searching for "maildir statistics" because somebody named the github repo https://github.com/smari/maildir-statistics yet it really isn't that general.
