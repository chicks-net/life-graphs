graphs of health, money, and technology


TECH TODO
---------

* pick a display system
* write more code

GRAPHS TODO
-----------

There are many graphs that I want to make, but these are the top priorities

* FINANCE: Citi balances
* FINANCE: OpenSRS balance
* FINANCE: paypal balances
* TECH: gmail inbox size
* TECH: fini inbox size
* TECH: dnetc key rate history
* TECH: github LoC committed
* TECH: Steam achievements and hours played
* HEALTH: miles walked
* HEALTH: pull ups

Emails graphs
-------------

For each of the various sources of email it'd be nice to have things like:

* sent emails per hour and day
* read emails per hour and day (how do you do that with alpine?)
* unread emails
* total emails
